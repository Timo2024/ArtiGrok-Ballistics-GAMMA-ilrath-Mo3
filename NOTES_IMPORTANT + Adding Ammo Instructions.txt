Merge between Arti and Groks ballistics (collaborative effort between Mo3 and ilrathCXV).

This is currently in the BETA stage. The merge is complete and incorporated into Grok's Ballistics, while taking advantage of Arti's conversion of bad ammo to special ammo types plus some special ammo effects.

Install notes:
Grok's/GAMMA's Ballistics has been overwritten just to include the special effects as well as some custom ammo support.
Please check all of the instructions on the post inside of GAMMA's Discord: https://discord.com/channels/912320241713958912/1065168136577482753/1065168136577482753

UNCHECK "183- GBOOBS BWRR patch - Grokitach" [ONLY IF YOU ARE USING Mo3's WarDogs Modpack]

You have TWO options for recoil: 
Grok's or Arti's. To choose Arti's, go to "Ballistics" in MCM and make sure it's checked, then go to GAMMA Enhanced Recoil in the MCM and uncheck it.
I suggest playing with both until you figure out which you like best, as they both did a great job. Personally, we both play with Grok's. However, there is some work being done to improve Arti's.

Although the merge is complete, you are free to reduce your hit power in the difficulty options if you feel too strong with these effects.

Instructions for implementing new ammo/modifying ammo into ArtiGrok (written by ilrathCXV - last updated March 2, 2024):

First, go into this mod's files and go to the directory: [this mod]\gamedata\configs\ammo
Next, either create a new .ltx (ammo_(custom_name_here).ltx without the parenthesis) or add it to the "ammo_extras_modded.ltx" file included with this mod.

We will now look at an example of an ammo type that will give you a good look at how these file entries should be structured.

Example of an ammo type that has nearly all the elements involoved in the system - 9x39 PAB9 Bad (FMJ variant)

[ammo_9x39_pab9_bad]:ammo_base					-- This is the debug name of the ammo. The ":ammo_base" allows it to inherit the base stats from the ammo base object of Anomaly (include this as a precaution).
name		= ammo_new_9x39_spp					-- This is no longer needed.
k_hit		= 1.3 								-- This is the "k_hit" parameter of the ammo. This isn't used by the system anymore as of Update 7. This value is pulled straight from the file the ammo is found in.
k_ap		= 0.348								-- This is the "k_ap" parameter of the ammo. It has been modified from Arti's system to give players a look at the BR/AP tier an ammo type has in Grok's BR/AP system. Pull the value from ammo's file (changes in here do not change actual parameter in calculations; change it via DLTX if you want to change it).
cost        = 2850								-- This is the "cost" parameter of the ammo. It was used by Arti's system to modify the cost of ammo. Pull the value from ammo's file or change it if the ammo is old ammo you are looking to change  (changes in here only take effect is the "Cost" option in this mod's MCM settings are turned on).
dg_ammo     = ammo_9x39_pab9					-- This parameter takes in another ammo that this ammo can degrade/convert to when looting (in order to offset the fact bad ammo - now special ammo - is more common to find on enemies). Highly recommended.
dg_chance   = 0.5								-- This parameter is the chance that this ammo will degrade/convert into the ammo in the above line. This MUST be used in combo with the above line if you choose to use this conversion system.
special     = ambush							-- Special: EXPLAINED LATER
special_2   = flinch							-- Special: EXPLAINED LATER
flinch      = 60								-- Special: EXPLAINED LATER

Now, to explain Special effects. I will show the Special effects, explain what they do and how to in corporate them into your ammo.
NOTE: Only TWO Special effects can be applied to a single ammo type (special = ... | special_2 = ...) and they CANNOT be the same special effect

Varmaggedon - This Special type increase the damage against mutants by 60% (does no additional damage against Stalkers). Recommended for use with HP/hunting rounds.

special     = varma								-- Special tag needed by the damage system to see if the ammo is of this type

Dragon's Breath - Self-explanatory. This allows the ammo to act like Dragon's Breath. Nullifies all mutant resistances. Changes hit type to Fire and applies 5 stacks of Burn per hit/per pellet.
Enemies take 0.5HP damage per Burn stack per second, up to 10HP per second. If no new Burn stacks are added to an enemy after 3 seconds, all Burn stacks are gone from that target.
If an enemy dies while having 20 or more Burn stacks, they will Ignite, randomly spreading their Burn stacks to targets nearby.
Recommended ONLY for shotguns.

special     = fire_melt							-- Special tag needed by the damage system to make use of this ammo's special effects

Acid Rounds - These rounds increases the amount of armor you take away from a Stalker who has a higher AP than the round's capabilities, and mutants will take 75% more damage from Acid Rounds. It changes the damage type to chemical burn.
Enemies that take 3 Acid hits from any combination of Acid rounds will apply the Armorbuster effect (EXPLAINED LATER) to itself and all targets within an 8m radius.

i_handler   = ballistic_handlers.particle				-- Used by Arti's system to call the particle function
i_particle  = artefact\\effects\\af_acidic_idle_color 	-- The particle effect used by the function called by the line above
special 	= acid										-- Special tag needed by the damage system to make use of this ammo's special effects

Shock Rounds - This special effect will apply Shock stacks to a target. Once an enemy reaches 20 or more Shock stacks, they will release a weak Lightning AoE.
Stalker headshots will DOUBLE the amount of stacks given by the round. Enemies hit by the Lightning AoE will count towards the Grounded counter. Recommended on small calibers.

special		 = shock							-- Special tag needed by the damage system to make use of this ammo's special effects
shock_stacks = 3								-- The amount of Shock stacks given on hit. I recommend staying within 2-6 Shock stacks (harder-hitting rounds should give more Shock)								

Lightning Rounds - This ammo creates an AoE damaging field when striking a stalker OR landing a "critical hit" on a mutant. Changes the damage type to shock damage.
For stalkers, AoE deals higher damage the higher the armor tier on hit, up to 70HP (70% of a Stalker's total max health).
For mutants, AoE deals 50HP on tougher mutants (check if a mutant's "spec_monster_mult" is > 0.85), else it will deal 40HP.
Headshots on stalkers will double their given armor rating, but will always be at least BR3. Recommended for large-caliber/sniper rounds.
Enemies who sustain 3 hits from a Lightning AoE (and somehow survive) will become Grounded, leaving them immobilized until they are killed.
Enemies hit by a Lightning AoE will receive Shock stacks based on the armor tier (BR3 = 1 stack, BR4 = 2 stacks, ... BR7+ = 7 stacks)

special 	= lightning							-- Special tag needed by the damage system to make use of this ammo's special effects

Ambush - If the hit target is (1) not aggro'd to/is unaware of the player or (2) the used weapon is suppressed/equipped with a silencer, this causes the ammo type to jump a whole BR/AP class in most cases and do 20% more damage.
Recommended for subsonic ammunition.

special		= ambush							-- Special tag needed by the damage system to make use of this ammo's special effects

Explosive - Self-explanatory. Releases a explosion on contact with a surface or an enemy (can hurt the player).
Each round will have a variable that will allow each explosive round to have unique performance on the explosion power, radius, number of fragments, etc.
Recommended for large-calbier/sniper rounds. Reduce the k_hit and k_ap of the round to compensate (below 0.5 and 0.3 respectively).

special     = explodes							-- Special tag needed by the damage system to make use of this ammo's special effects
exp_mult	= 1									-- Multipler for frag/explosion damage, explosion radius, and amount of frags released

Headhunter - One of the strongest effects in the game. This effect is only applied to headshots. It (1) increases the ammo's k_ap to 1.00 (max), (2) loses no damage on overpentration, and (3) negates Sin and ISG resistances.
Eidelon will still put up a good fight against the round. Recommended for large-caliber/sniper rounds + make the round stupid expensive to craft and to buy.

special     = head								-- Special tag needed by the damage system to make use of this ammo's special effects

Fragmentation - Similar to Expansion, this allows the round to do extra damage to a target due to fragmentation on impact. This is based on chance and only affects mutants and full penetration on Stalkers.
On successful roll, you will receive an additional 30% damage. The chance is define by the "frag" varaible in the ammo_*.ltx files.

special     = frag								-- Special tag needed by the damage system to make use of this ammo's special effects
frag        = 0.7								-- Determines the percent chance that you will do fragment on damage on mutants and on full-pen hits on Stalkers

RIP Rounds - These rounds heal the player equal to 25% of the damage dealt. These are better suited on larger rounds that can output major damage, allowing near-full heals on hits.

special     = rip								-- Special tag needed by the damage system to make use of this ammo's special effects

Soulripper - These rounds heal the player for 15% of their total HP on a kill. Recommended for smaller calibers.

special     = soulripper						-- Special tag needed by the damage system to make use of this ammo's special effects

Incendiary/API Rounds - These are Incendiary Armor Piercing Rounds. They have amazing AP values with a chance to ignite an enemy on hit. However, this round does NOT change the damage type to fire.
These rounds will apply Burn stacks to a target on hit, according to the "burn_stacks" stat. If none is given, the stack amount will always be 1 stack.
Enemies take 1HP damage per Burn stack per second, up to 25HP per second. If no new Burn stacks are added to an enemy after 3 seconds, all Burn stacks are gone from that target.
If an enemy dies while having 20 or more Burn stacks, they will Ignite, randomly spreading their Burn stacks to targets nearby.
Landing a headshot will double the burn stacks received.
Recommended for rifle/sniper AP rounds.

special		= fire 								-- Special tag needed by the damage system to make use of this ammo's special effects (not to be confused with Dragon's Breath's "fire_melt" Special tag)
burn_stacks = 2									-- The amount of Burn stacks given on hit. I recommend staying within 2-6 Burn stacks (harder-hitting rounds should give more Burn)

Flinch/Stun Capability - This Special has a chance to stun a human target/stalker on hit, as well as jamming/unloading their weapon's ammo. It is on a 1 second cooldown.

special     = flinch							-- Special tag needed by the damage system to make use of this ammo's special effects
flinch      = 0.5								-- Flinch/stun chance. Recommended to be set between (0.5 - 0.95).

Cloudkill - This special effect (1) applies a stacking +20% damage buff per hit and (2) applies a stacking +5% damage reduction from damage from affected enemies, up to 40% damage reduction.
This effect applies to the target hit and to any enemies within 5m of the hit target.

special		= toxic								-- Special tag needed by the damage system to make use of this ammo's special effects

Basher - This special effect is a weaker version of the Headhunter effect; it ignores all armor on a target, but any base resistances (i.e. ISG damage reduction) will still be in effect.
This still requires hitting the head in order to work. This was mainly created for melee weapons (their "ammo"), but can be utilized on regualr ammo as well.

special		= basher							-- Special tag needed by the damage system to make use of this ammo's special effects

Armorbuster - This special effect ignores some mutant damage resistances + increases the amount of armor destroyed on a Stalker hit by 30% + 1.
This will NOT make a hit count as a full-penetration hit if the inital AP of the round was not enough to fully penetrate on its own.

special		= armorbuster						-- Special tag needed by the damage system to make use of this ammo's special effects

Chaos/Unstable Core Rounds - These are the most interesting rounds in the game. These rounds can pull from nearly every Special Type. This round randomly does anywhere between 60 - 160% damage and AP of its base stats.
Random effects include : +4 Burn stacks (8%), Stun/Flinch (16%), 10% Damage Heal (8%), Basher (4%), Acid (16%), Explosive (4%), Lightning (8%), Cloudkill (12%)
Random chance for no effect: 24%
Recommended for FMJ/AP rounds due to the need for an "unstable core"

special     = chaos								-- Special tag needed by the damage system to make use of this ammo's special effects

Graze Rounds - These rounds will share a portion of the damage to adjacent targets.
If the target is hit in the head or in a critical area (i.e boars on their stomachs), targets within 8m will receive 25% of the original damage dealt to the hit target.
Else, targets within 5m will receive 5% of the original damage dealt to the hit target.
Recommended on sniper rounds, or on rounds that typically are used in bolt-action/pump-action weapons.

special		= graze								-- Special tag needed by the damage system to make use of this ammo's special effects

Grav Rounds - These rounds travel fast and have nearly no air resistance/bullet drop, and receive an AP multiplier if the target is more than 100m away.
The AP bonus goes up to a 2x multiplier. The AP multipler is simply a damage multipler against mutants (but I wouldn't advise using AP on them).
In the calculations, the distance is changed to 1m to ensure there is no range damage or AP penalty.
To acheive the former, you must at least double the "k_bullet_speed" value and make the "k_air_resistance" value be 0.01 at the lowest inside the 
rounds actual stats (not talking about the ammo_*.ltx file).
Recommended on FMJ+ or AP+ rounds.

special		= grav								-- Special tag needed by the damage system to make use of this ammo's special effects
