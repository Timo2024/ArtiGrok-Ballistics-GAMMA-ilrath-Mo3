		<text>.300 Blackout (7.62x35mm) AP cartridge loaded with an 8.4 gram armor-piercing bullet from a 7.62x51mm NATO M80A1 cartridge, composed of a steel penetrator tip over a copper alloy core with a copper semi-jacket in a brass case. Despite the bullet's own characteristics when used in a full-power cartridge, these are affected when transferred to an intermediate cartridge. However, the bullet continues to have capabilities to pierce basic and intermediate body ballistic protections, in addition to being able to cause substantial adverse effects on the target after impact. Its design also allows it to be used in STANAG 5.56x45mm NATO magazines without any issues.</text>

		<text>.300 Blackout (7.62x35mm) BCP FMJ cartridge with a 9.4 gram lead core bullet with a bimetallic jacket in a steel case; intended for hunting, home defense, and target practice, produced by Barnaul Cartridge Plant. Thanks to its rudimentary design, this cartridge is one of the most economical options of its caliber, and, despite this, the bullet in this cartridge has capabilities to pierce basic ballistic body protection and provide considerable stopping power. However, it has a significant bounce probability on various surfaces. Its design also allows it to be used in STANAG 5.56x45mm NATO magazines without any problem.</text>
