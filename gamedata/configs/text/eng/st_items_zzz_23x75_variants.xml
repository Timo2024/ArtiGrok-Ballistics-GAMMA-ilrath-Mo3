	<string id="ammo_23x75_chaos_descr">
		<text>Whether created by Sin to cleanse the Zone or by some hooligan shoving grounded-up artefacts into a cartridge, these monsterous rounds exemplify the pure chaos of the Zone. Each pellet has a various suite of effects granted by the Zone, ranging from randomizing the stopping power of the pellet, to setting the target on fire, to creating a explosion on contact. Its power is most-fitting in that it is used in weapons able to withstand 4-gauge ammunition.</text>

	<string id="ammo_23x75_mini_napalm_descr">
		<text>This "slug" is a very potent crowd-control round. The shell contains a mixture of fire-based artefact powders with strong propellant. When hitting an enemy or surface, it erupts into a firey bomb, setting any target within a 5-meter radius is ablaze. Direct impact with to a target results in devastating power. Although not containing actual napalm, the name given to this cartridge matches the destructive power it leaves in its wake.</text>
