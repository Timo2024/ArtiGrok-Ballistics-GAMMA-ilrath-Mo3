	<string id="st_af_pin_descr">
		<text>A small artefact formed by thermal anomalies in the Zone under extreme temperatures. The look suggests that it was an organ of a vascular plant. Further studies showed that other organic tissues are fused deep inside. The stem doesn't hold any useful properties. On the contrary, the small pins reduce the temperature of the user's body and cools all objects in their vicinity. This artefact offers slight psy-protection as it will resonate under the influence of psy-waves. On the other hand, it is not recommended to approach chemical and acid anomalies when in possession of the artefact as it will increase the adverse effects of acids and toxins in the user's bloodstream.\n \n

	<string id="st_af_cristall_descr">
		<text>This artefact is formed in anomalous zones with intense thermal activity. Actively consumes heat and remains cool at all times. It will also protect the user against electrical currents. On the other hand, exposure to such environments makes the artefact increase conductivity due to unknown mechanisms. This artefact is also highly sought after by jewelers outside the Zone as its inner core is not radioactive and considered to be of exceptional beauty if polished and refined. Only the first 1cm of its outer layer emits radiation. It is, however, highly advised to proceed with caution when planning to bring the artefact to the market as prolonged exposure to even minimal amounts of radioactive materials can result in the death of the user. Relatively heavy and dense.\n \n

		<text>"Fireball"</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_af_fireball_descr">
		<text>A spherical artefact made of a red-coloured crystal, created in the Burner anomaly. It has a unique property: a constant temperature of 75 degrees Fahrenheit/24 degrees Celsius, regardless of its surroundings. This allows it to absorb heat from its vicinity and to create a little pocket around the user which prevents the fire from damaging the body. A dangerous effect of this artefact is that it will increase electrical conductivity, so the probability of electrocution while wearing it is much higher, especially during storms and in the vicinity of electrical anomalies. It is quite heavy and dense.\n \n

	<string id="st_af_blood_descr">
		<text>A reddish formation of compressed fossilized plants, soil and animal debris. Can partially neutralize chemical poisons by absorbing them and reducing the overall toxicity level in the user's bloodstream. Quite common and not very effective as it makes chemical burns fester. It will catch fire when exposed to open flame or even spontaneously combust. Another positive effect possessed by this artefact is that it accelerates clotting if worn close to the body. Although it is not recommended to keep this artefact in your possession for longer periods of time as blood clots can also be hazardous to your health.\n \n

		<text>This artefact has a soft, porous, skin-like texture. It resembles and acts like a sponge in this regard, but reveals its special characteristics only when exposed to certain external conditions. Firstly, the pores on its surface are known to absorb small amounts of toxicity from the environment. Secondly, the artefact slightly amplifies the damaging effects of psy-fields to living organisms by absorbing psy-energy and emitting it at a small rate. Thirdly, it is known to be a conductor of electricity.\n \n

		<text>This artefact has the appearance of translucent spider webs and just like spider silk, it is sticky and has properties of glue. It can be found most commonly in or near electro anomalies and is able to smooth fluctuations in electric field density, acting as a weak resistor, protecting the wearer from electricity and reducing its damaging effects. On the other hand, it should be noted that the presence of this artefact increases the corrosiveness of acids, leading to accelerated deterioration of equipment and higher damage to the tissues of organisms.\n \n

		<text>Very common in the Zone. This gravitational artefact is able to slightly shield the body and objects from physical impacts. It will also slightly protect its user against the extreme heat produced by fire anomalies. This artefact is quite heavy as the gravitational field seems to increase its mass. Another downside is that it will increases the negative effects of psy-waves.\n \n

	<string id="st_af_vyvert_descr">
		<text>This bizarrely-shaped artefact appears in places with increased gravitational activity. Although it appears almost organic, it is actually more similar to coral. Due to its gravitational nature, it provides protection against physical impacts as it greatly reduces the friction caused by fast moving objects. It also acts as a kind of sponge that absorbs chemical and toxic elements as well, providing protection from external toxic agents as well as from chemical particles that have already made their way into the body. Wrenced can generate a locally directed gravity field which increases its mass making the object very dense.\n \n

		<text>"Nightstar"</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_af_night_star_descr">
		<text>This glowing artefact can generate a locally directed low-gravity field. Widely used by stalkers along with Gravi, a similar artefact, to increase maximum load. Due to its beautiful inner core, it is highly sought after by jewellers all over the world, however it is best to proceed with caution as unskilled treatment can cause the artefact to explode with power sufficient to level a small building. It is thus highly advised to perform the polishing by means of specialized machinery which minimizes the probability of an explosion. Only the outer core of the artefact emits radiation. Nightstar will also absorb toxic and chemical agents from the environment, making it a valuable artefact for artefact hunters, even though the amount of toxicity absorbed is negligible. It is, however, relatively cheap and even stalkers with pretty tight budgets can afford it. That being said, Nightstar emits odour of burning flesh when in the closest proximity of heat source. Prolonged exposure may enhance its flammability and cause it to ignite.\n \n

	<string id="st_af_gravi_descr">
		<text>Gravi is formed from metallic substances exposed to prolonged gravitation. This makes it capable of sustaining a powerful anti-gravitational field, reducing the weight of all objects in proximity. For a long time, this artefact was a mystery, and it was scientist Sakharov at Yantar who first discovered that Gravi creates a minute-long singularity field of anti-gravitational nature, occurring in intervals of 30 minutes. A dangerous effect of this artefact is that it increases electrical conductivity, so the probability of electrocution while wearing this artefact is much higher, especially during storms and in the vicinity of electrical anomalies. It also will increase the negative effects of psy-waves and is a potent conductor.\n \n

	<string id="st_af_dummy_battery_descr">
		<text>This artefact is quite popular in the Zone and is valued by its residents and visitors alike for its energizing properties, although it has an adverse effect on the body when used for prolonged periods of time. On the other hand, it is a powerful resistor, it is well known for its ability to shield its user from lethal doses of electricity. However, this artefact hinders blood clotting and increases bleed rate and is known to absorb heat and transfer it to other objects. This artefact is also extremely light and very portable.\n \n

	<string id="st_af_death_lamp_descr">
		<text>"Big, red and cursed." This is how the locals prefer to describe the Death Lamp, while some refer to it as the "Seed of Satan". Many traders believe the rumours surrounding the artefact, thus refusing to buy it. Little is known about its origins, and nothing of value has been discovered so far. Death Lamp was first discovered a few years ago by a group of three experienced stalkers. Shortly after delivering the artefact to the Ecologists in Yantar, two of them were found dead with a horrific expression on their face. Nothing is known about the fate of the third stalker. Following the accident, members of the science team who studied the artefact had reported having nightmare disorder in the days to follow. Apart from the mysterious effects, the artefact drains vitality and willpower from the user, often on such a scale that it induces dizziness and in extreme cases causes the user to faint.\n \n

		<text>The origins of artefacts such as this one are a mystery, as they are rarely found outside the northernmost parts of the Zone. This unique artefact projects a non-contact field that inhibits nearby anomalous phenomena. This grants the wearer a notable level of protection against most of the Zone's environmental hazards. It is also one of the few active artefacts that can be safely handled without lead containers. However, when you hold it your flesh feels dry and flaky, your bones hard and stiff, the ligaments in your joints squeaky and brittle. Thick armor or great supernatural vitality would be needed by anyone intending to wear this artefact into battle.\n \n
